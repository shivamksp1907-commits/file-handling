        "\n",
        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime, which makes debugging easier but\n",
        "execution slower. Compiled languages are converted into machine code before execution, making\n",
        "them faster but harder to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally\n",
        "blocks so that the program does not crash unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The finally block always executes whether an exception occurs or not. It is mainly used for cleanup\n",
        "tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Logging is used to record messages about a program’s execution for debugging, monitoring, and\n",
        "error tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used\n",
        "for cleanup activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: import loads the entire module, while from ... import loads specific functions\n",
        "or variables from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks or by\n",
        "grouping exceptions together in one except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The with statement automatically closes the file after its operations are\n",
        "completed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process and shares\n",
        "memory, while multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory\n",
        "spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Logging helps in debugging, monitoring application behavior, tracking errors,\n",
        "and maintaining execution records.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Memory management in Python refers to the automatic allocation and\n",
        "deallocation of memory by Python during program execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The steps include writing risky code inside try, handling errors using except,\n",
        "using else if no error occurs, and cleanup using finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: It prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures efficient use\n",
        "of system resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The try block contains code that may raise an error, while the except block\n",
        "handles the error gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Python uses reference counting and a garbage collector to automatically\n",
        "remove unused objects from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The else block executes when no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and\n",
        "CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: os.fork() creates a child process in Unix systems, while multiprocessing\n",
        "works on all platforms and is safer to use.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: Closing a file releases system resources and ensures that all data is saved\n",

        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline()?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: file.read() reads the entire file at once, while file.readline() reads one line at a\n",
        "time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
